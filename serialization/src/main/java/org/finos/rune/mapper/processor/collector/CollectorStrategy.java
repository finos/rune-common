/**
 * A strategy interface for collecting and introspecting data from a {@link RosettaModelObject}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface define custom logic to traverse a given model object
 * and extract relevant information. This follows the Strategy design pattern, allowing
 * different collection behaviors to be applied dynamically based on the use case.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Typical use cases include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Collecting information about keys and references in the model</li>
 *     <li>Gathering specific data points from the model</li>
 *     <li>Validating or analyzing object structures</li>
 *     <li>Building summaries or reports based on model contents</li>
 * </ul>
